## 🚀 The Concept
The goal of this project was to move beyond the "Static PDF" era. By using AI as a development team rather than just a search engine, I built a web-based strategy deck that uses motion and interactivity to drive engagement.

## 🛠️ The "Triple Threat" AI Stack
This project was developed through the strategic orchestration of three LLMs:

* **ChatGPT (The Architect):** Handled the core JavaScript logic and project scaffolding.
* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet (The Creative):** Refined the copy, storytelling flow, and nuanced CSS transitions.
* **Gemini (The Visualizer):** Optimized UI/UX responsiveness and performed deep-dive debugging on complex animation layers.

## 📦 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React / Next.js
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / Framer Motion (for cinematic transitions)
* **Deployment:** Vercel
* **AI Orchestration:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

## 💡 Key Learnings
* **AI as a Force Multiplier:** How to build production-ready code as a non-developer.
* **Prompt Engineering:** Iterative feedback loops between models to solve "z-index" and scroll-sync bugs.
* **Productivity:** Reducing "Concept-to-Live" time by 80%.
